# An Introduction to Transparent Machine Learning

```{note}
Version (status): pre-alpha (under design and development)
```

## Course overview

This self-paced online learning course aims to introduce essential materials on transparent machine learning for learners of diverse backgrounds to understand and apply transparent machine learning in real-world applications with confidence and trust, targeting a missing gap in the online educational space.

## Learning objectives [LOs]

By the end of the course, a learner will be able to demonstrate the ability to

- [LO1] understand the theoretical issues and wider context related to transparent machine learning systems and processes

- [LO2] understand the inner-working of a selected number of transparent machine learning algorithms with the capability of interpret the modelling process and the input-output relationships

- [LO3] deploy a practical implementation of transparent machine learning systems and processes in a real-world setting using Python libraries such as scikit-learn

- [LO4] visualise, interpret, and explain transparent machine learning systems and processes in a real-world setting to help stakeholders understand these systems and processes

## Target audience

Learners from diverse backgrounds, preferably with knowledge and skills of basic mathematics (particularly probability and linear algebra) and Python programming for machine learning.
