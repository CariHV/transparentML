## Organisation

The rest of this book is organised into nine chapters, with appendices at the end. Each chapter will focus on either the system or the process.

**(Add hyperlink to the chapters later)**

We have seven chapters on ML systems, which are: Chapter 2 on linear regression, Chapter 3 on logistic regression and and linear discriminant analysis, Chapter 6 on feature subset selection and shrinkage, Chapter 7 on decision trees and random forest, Chapter 8 on naive Bayes, generalised linear models, and support vector machines, Chapter 9 on principal component analysis and k-means clustering, and Chapter 10 on deep learning with convolutional and recurrent neural networks. These chapters will cover the system side of ML. Real-world applications will be used to illustrate the concepts and techniques.

We have two chapters on ML processes, which are: Chapter 4 on cross validation and bootstrap, and Chapter 5 on hypothesis testing and software development. These chapters will cover the process side of ML, including leave-one-out/k-fold cross validation,bootstrap, types of errors, significance of results, and the software development life cycle on GitHub.
