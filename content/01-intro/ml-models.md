### Machine learning models

This course focuses on machine learning models (or methods) that are most widely used in practice, while NOT aiming to be exhaustive in covering all the models. The following table shows the machine learning models that we will cover in this course.

No single model will perform well in all possible scenarios. Therefore, it is important to understand the assumptions and trade-offs of each model so that you can choose the right model for a given problem.
