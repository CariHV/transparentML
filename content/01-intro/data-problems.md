## Data and problems

This section introduces the real-world datasets used in this course. We will also learn about the machine learning problems that can be solved using these datasets. Before we talk about the datasets, let's first define what machine learning is.

### Real-world datasets in this course

In this course, we will use real-world datasets to introduce machine learning from the perspective of AI transparency. We will use the following datasets from the textbook. You can click on the name of the dataset to see the actual data.

The above datasets show the diverse range of problems that machine learning can solve, which shows only the tip of the iceberg actually. Applications of machine learning are everywhere, from healthcare to finance, from manufacturing to agriculture, from transportation to education, and so on. The datasets used in this course are from the textbook, which is a good starting point for learning about machine learning. However, you can also find many other datasets online, such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/), [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), and so on.

Next, let us learn about the machine learning problems in their typical definitions.
