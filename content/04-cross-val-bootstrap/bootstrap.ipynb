    "The bootstrap is a widely applicable and extremely powerful statistical tool that can be used to quantify the uncertainty associated with a given estimator or statistical learning method. As a simple example, the bootstrap can be used to estimate the standard errors of the coefficients from a linear regression fit. Although standard errors were obtained automatically by `statsmodels` in {doc}`Linear regression <../00-prereq/overview>` and {doc}`Logistic regression <../03-logistic-reg/overview>`, the power of the bootstrap lies in the fact that it can be easily applied to a wide range of statistical learning methods.\n",

    "## The bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we wish to estimate the uncertainly of a coefficient estimate $\\beta_1$ from a linear regression fit, we take \n",
    "$n$ repeated samples with replacement from our dataset and train our linear regression model $n$ times and record each value $\\hat{\\beta}_1^{*1}, \\hat{\\beta}_1^{*2}, \\dots, \\hat{\\beta}_1^{*n}$. With enough resampling - typically 1000 or 10,000 - we can plot the distribution of these bootstrapped estimates $\\hat{\\beta}_1^{*i}, i = 1,\\dots, n $. Then, we can use the resulting distribution to quantify the variability of this estimate by calculating useful summary statistics, such as standard errors and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of the bootstrap lies in the ability to take repeated samples of the dataset, instead of collecting a new dataset each time. Also, in contrast to standard error estimates typically reported with statistical software that rely on algebraic methods and underlying assumptions, bootstrapped standard error estimates are more accurate as they are calculated computationally.\n",
