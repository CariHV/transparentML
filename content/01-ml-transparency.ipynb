    "Machine learning takes data as **input** to learn a **model**, a mathematical representation of the data. This learned model can take new data as input to generate **output** for making predictions on the new data or for exploring/explaining the new data. In this chapter, we will learn about the components of typical machine learning systems and steps in typical machine learning processes. We will also learn about the definition and taxonomy of AI transparency. We will start with the real-world datasets used in this course to see how machine learning can be used in real-world.\n",

    "The above datasets show the diverse range of problems that machine learning can solve, which shows only the tip of the iceberg actually. Next, let us learn about the machine learning problems in their typical definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine learning problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning problems can be broadly classified into two categories: **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**. In supervised learning, the data is labelled, and the goal is to predict the label for new data. In unsupervised learning, the data is not labelled, and the goal is to find patterns in the data. Machine learning models can generate two types of outputs: discrete and continuous. Discrete outputs are categorical, such as the class of an image. Continuous outputs are numerical, such as the price of a house. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, supervised learning can be further divided into classification and regression. In **classification**, the output is a discrete value, such as a label or a class. In **regression**, the output is a continuous value, such as a number or a probability. Unsupervised learning can be further divided into clustering and dimensionality reduction. In **clustering**, the goal is to find groups of similar data points so the output is a discrete value, such as a cluster index. In **dimensionality reduction**, the goal is to find a lower-dimensional representation of the data so the output is of continuous values, such as a vector.\n",
