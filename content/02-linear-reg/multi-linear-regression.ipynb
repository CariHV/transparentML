    "- Comparing these coefficients to the estimates in simple linear regression, we notice that the multiple regression coefficient estimates for `TV` and `radio` are pretty similar to the simple linear regression coefficient estimates. However, while the `newspaper` regression coefficient estimate in simple linear regression was significantly non-zero, the coefficient estimate for `newspaper` in the multiple regression model is close to zero, and the corresponding p-value is no longer significant, with a value around 0.86. \n",
    "- This illustrates that the simple and multiple regression coefficient can be quite different. This difference stems from the fact that in the simple regression case, the slope term represents the average increase in product sales associated with a \\$1,000 increase in newspaper advertising, ignoring other predictors such as `TV` and `radio`. By contrast, in the multiple regression setting, the coefficient for `newspaper` represents the average increase in product `sales` associated with increasing `newspaper` spending by \\$1,000 while holding `TV` and `radio` fixed.\n",

    "This indicates that markets with high `newspaper` advertising tend to also have high `radio` advertising. Now suppose that the multiple regression is correct and `newspaper` advertising is not associated with sales, but `radio` advertising is associated with `sales`. Then in markets where we spend more on `radio` our sales will tend to be higher, and as our correlation matrix shows, we also tend to spend more on newspaper advertising in those same markets. Hence, in a simple linear regression which only examines sales versus `newspaper`, we will observe that higher values of `newspaper` tend to be associated with higher values of `sales` , even though newspaper advertising is not directly associated with sales. So newspaper advertising is a surrogate for `radio` advertising; `newspaper` gets “credit” for the association between `radio` on `sales`.\n",
