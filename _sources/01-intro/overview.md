# Intro to Machine Learning & Transparency

<!-- **Question**: What is machine learning and what is AI transparency? -->

```{admonition} Objectives
- Understand real-world datasets used in this course
- Understand components of typical machine learning systems
- Understand steps in typical machine learning processes
- Understand AI transparency definition & taxonomy
```

**Expected time to complete**: 4 hours

In this chapter, we will learn about the components of typical machine learning systems and steps in typical machine learning processes. We will also learn about the definition and taxonomy of AI transparency. We will start with the real-world datasets used in this course to see how machine learning can be used in real-world.
