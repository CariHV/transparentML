    "## K-Nearest Neighbors classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm. It is a _non-parametric_ method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the $k$ closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether KNN is used for classification or regression. Here, we focus on the classification case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ingredients & transparency\n",
    "For all machine learning models covered in this course, we aim to talk about their ingredients and transparency in a standard way to facilitate understanding their similarities and differences. For transparency, we will focus on the system transparency, i.e. system logic. Process transparency is not specific to ML models and it will be discussed when we cover the ML process/lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ingredients of a KNN model are the training data. The transparency of a KNN model is the distance between the test point and the training points.\n",

    "### Example: Iris classification\n",
    "\n",
    "We adapt the [KNN example from scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/neighbors/plot_classification.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-neighbors-plot-classification-py) to illustrate the use of KNN for classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we use the Iris dataset, which is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It is included in scikit-learn and we load it as follows.\n",
