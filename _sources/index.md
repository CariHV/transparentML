# Overview

Welcome to **An Introduction to Transparent Machine Learning**. This self-paced online learning course aims to introduce essential materials on transparent machine learning for learners of diverse backgrounds to understand and apply transparent machine learning in real-world applications with confidence and trust, targeting a missing gap in the online educational space. It is an adaptation of the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www.statlearning.com/) {cite}`james2021statistical`, from the perspective of AI transparency detailed in the [AI in Financial Services](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2021-06/ati_ai_in_financial_services_lores.pdf) report {cite}`ostmann2021ai`.

## Learning objectives [LOs]

By the end of the course, a learner will be able to demonstrate the ability to

- [LO1] understand the theoretical issues and wider context related to transparent machine learning systems and processes

- [LO2] understand the inner-working of a selected number of transparent machine learning algorithms with the capability of interpret the modelling process and the input-output relationships

- [LO3] deploy a practical implementation of transparent machine learning systems and processes in a real-world setting using Python libraries such as scikit-learn

- [LO4] visualise, interpret, and explain transparent machine learning systems and processes in a real-world setting to help stakeholders understand these systems and processes

## Target audience

Learners from diverse backgrounds, preferably with knowledge and skills of basic mathematics (particularly probability and linear algebra) and Python programming for machine learning.

## How to go through the course

The course is designed to be self-paced and self-directed. The course materials are organised into a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) consisting of 10 chapters, plus prerequisites. Each chapter has a number of sections. Each section is a self-contained unit of learning and should take no more than 30 minutes to complete, ending with an exercise. Each chapter will have a quiz for assessment. For each chapter, we suggest you to go through the materials of each section in the browse (html) first and then launch (via <i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>) the corresponding Jupyter notebook to run the code and complete the exercises. _Optional: You can also download the Jupyter notebooks and [run them locally on your machine](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html) after [installation](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)._

The course is designed to be completed in 40 hours, but you can take as long as you need to complete the course.
