This chapter introduces the linear regression model, which is the most common model used in statistics and machine learning. The linear regression model is a linear model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables `(X)` and the single output variable `(y)`. More specifically, that output `(y)` can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables `(X)`. The coefficients of this linear combination are referred to as the model coefficients or model parameters. The linear regression model is a parametric model, meaning that the number of parameters that must be estimated from the data is the same as the number of input variables. The linear regression model is also a linear model, meaning that the model output `(y)` is a linear function of the model coefficients `(Î²)`. The linear regression model is a supervised learning model, meaning that it is trained on data that contains the input and output variables that we are interested in modelling. The linear regression model is a predictive modelling problem, meaning that we are interested in using the model to make predictions on new data. The linear regression model is a regression model, meaning that the output variable `(y)` is a real value, such as a price or a probability. The linear regression model is a simple model, meaning that it has a small number of parameters, and is easy to interpret. The linear regression model is a closed-form model, meaning that the model can be fit directly without the use of iterative optimization algorithms. The linear regression model is a model that can be used for both regression and classification predictive modelling problems. The linear regression model is a model that can be used for both regression and classification predictive modelling problems.

This chapter will explain linear regression using the example of analysing `Advertising` data. The `Advertising` dataset contains sales revenue generated with respect to advertisement spends across multiple channels (TV, radio, newspaper) for a single product in a single market. The goal is to predict sales revenue based on the advertisement spends. By analysing this dataset, we will try to answer the 7 following questions:

1. Is there a relationship between advertising budget and sales?
2. How strong is the relationship between advertising budget and sales?
3. Which media are associated with sales?
4. How large is the association between each medium and sales?
5. How accurately can we predict future sales?
6. Is the relationship linear?
7. Is there synergy among the advertising media?
